Putting Your Extension on a Web Server

To make your extension available via a web server:

    Build and sign the extension in Extension Builder to create a .safariextz file.

    Include a link to a copy of your .safariextz folder on your website. Be sure to include a description of what your extension does.

    Make sure your web server is serving the extension using the MIME type application/octet-stream.

    Most web servers maintain a table of file extensions and MIME types, and provide an administrative tool for updating the table. For example, to add a MIME type to an Apache web server, use the AddType directive:

    AddType application/octet-stream .safariextz

    For IIS web servers, the MIME settings are typically accessed using the MMC by right-clicking the host computer name and choosing Properties, then adding a new MIME setting and file extension.

For more information, consult the vendor’s documentation for your web server, or do a web search for “add MIME type” + YourWebServer + YourVersionNumber.

Tip: If necessary, you can arrange to serve multiple versions of your extension for compatibility with different Safari versions. To do this, set up your download URL as a CGI script (such as PHP, Perl, or Python) that examines the HTTP User[&#8209;]Agent header string to determine which version of Safari the user is using, and sends a redirect via the Location header to the appropriate .safariextz file.
